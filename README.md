## üí™üèº Features

Some of the features the calculator provides are:

* üí• **Precise calculation**: Instantly calculates how many explosives or shots are needed to destroy any structure based on its HP, material and weapon type
* üî¢ **Detailed resource cost**: Shows the exact resource cost to craft the required ammo
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Automatic 6x cave damage option**: Adjusts all damage values when the structure is inside a cave
* üìä **Supports multiple weapons & materials**: Includes C4, Rocket Launcher, Tek Rifle, Cannon, Grenades and Catapult; calculates for Wood, Stone, Metal and Tek structures
* ü™∂ **Lightweight console application**: Runs directly from terminal, fast and minimal
* üé® **Colored & formatted output**: Uses ANSI codes for better readability in terminal (bold, colors etc.)
* ü¶ñ **Customized version for Beginners Next Gen**: Dedicated `-bng` version customized for the most popular ASE Beginner Server


### ‚ùî Detailed Description

This calculator is used to determine the amount of ammunition and cost of resources required to destroy structures in Ark: Survival Evolved and Ark: Survival Ascended.
The program allows you to enter the type of weapon, the HP and material of the structure and the presence of 6x cave damage.
It then calculates the amount of explosives/ammunition needed and displays the resource cost of crafting the ammo.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

ArkCulator does not need any installation in order to run. You can execute the .exe file anywhere.

After executing the file the first time you will be prompted by the Windows Defender SmartScreen that the file is unknown to Microsoft and may be harmful.
This is expected and can only be avoided if I, as a developer, pay at least ‚Ç¨300 annually for a signing certificate.
As I do not plan to pay for this, you will now have to endure this message and first click on ‚ÄúMore info‚Äù and then ‚ÄúRun anyway‚Äù.

![WinDefenderSmartScreenMessage](img/smartScreenMessage.png)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You are able to verify the source code of the executable inside the C++ file in the `cpp` folder.

## üöÄ Usage

The calculator will ask you a total of 4 questions in order to calculate the amount of ammunition you need to destroy a structure.
Always confirm with `ENTER` after an input. After answering a question, your answer will be displayed in front of the next question.

1. What weapon do you want to destroy with?

   `Enter weapon [1(C4)/2(Rocket Launcher)/3(Tek Rifle)/4(Cannon)/5(Grenade)/6(Catapult)]`

    Simply enter the respective number of the weapon (e.g. `3` for the Tek Rifle)


2. What type of Structure you want to destroy?

   `Enter material of structure [wood/stone/metal/tek]`

    You can either write the full word or just the first letter (e.g. `t` for tek)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If the selected structure type is indestructible by the selected weapon, you will receive a message before you can make any further entries.


3. How many HP has this structure right now?

   `Enter HP of structure`

    A number between 1 and 100'000


4. Is the structure you want to attack in range of the 6x cave damage multiplier?

   `Cave damage? [yes/no]`

    Enter yes, no or just the respective first letter of the word (e.g. `n` for no)


Now you will see how much ammunition you need to destroy the structure with the selected weapon, like for example:

`[Grenade|Wood|10000 HP|No Cave] Grenades needed to destroy: 13`

In addition, you will see what production costs you can expect in order to produce the specified amount of ammunition:
```
Resources needed to craft:
Gunpowder: 390
Fiber: 195
Hide: 65
Metal: 26
Oil: 52
Stone: 260
```

The process then starts all over again. The first question is asked again directly for the next calculation.

You can end the application with the key combination `Ctrl+C` or just by simply closing the window.
