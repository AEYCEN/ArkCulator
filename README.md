## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

ArkCulator does not need any installation in order to run. You can execute the .exe file anywhere.

After executing the file the first time you will be prompted by the Windows Defender SmartScreen that the file is unknown to Microsoft and may be harmful.
This is expected and can only be avoided if I, as a developer, pay at least ‚Ç¨300 annually for a signing certificate.
As I do not plan to pay for this, you will now have to endure this message and first click on ‚ÄúMore info‚Äù and then ‚ÄúRun anyway‚Äù.

> [!TIP]
> You are able to verify the source code of the executable inside the C++ file in the `cpp` folder.

## üöÄ Usage

The calculator will ask you questions in order to calculate the amount of ammunition you need to destroy a structure.
Always confirm with `ENTER` after an input. After answering a question, your answer will be displayed in front of the next question.

1. In what mode do yuo want to use ArkCulator?

   `Enter calculator mode [ENTER for normal / bng for Beginners Next Gen]`

   Simply press the `ENTER` key for the normal mode or type `bng` for the Beginners Next Gen servers adjusted mode.   


2. What weapon do you want to destroy with?

   ```
   Enter weapon:
      1 - C4
      2 - Cannon
      3 - Catapult
      4 - Grenade
      5 - Rocket Launcher
      6 - Tek Grenade
      7 - Tek Rifle
   ```

    Enter the respective number or the name of the weapon (e.g. `4` or `grenade` for grenades)

> [!NOTE]
> If you selected the tek rifle, it will proceed to ask you of what quality it is. Questioned is the percentage of damage. For a normal tek rifle just enter `100`.


3. What type of Structure you want to destroy?

   `Enter material of structure [wood/stone/metal/tek]`

    You can either write the full word or just the first letter (e.g. `t` for tek)

> [!NOTE]
> If the selected structure type is indestructible by the selected weapon, you will receive a message before you can make any further entries.


4. How many HP has this structure right now?

   `Enter HP of structure`

    A number between 1 and 250'000


5. Is the structure you want to attack in range of the 6x cave damage multiplier?

   `Cave damage? [yes/no]`

    Enter yes, no or just the respective first letter of the word (e.g. `n` for no)


Now you will see how much ammunition you need to destroy the structure with the selected weapon, like for example:

`[Grenade|Wood|10000 HP|No Cave] Grenades needed to destroy: 13`

In addition, you will see what production costs you can expect in order to produce the specified amount of ammunition:
```
Resources needed to craft:
390 Gunpowder
195 Fiber
65 Hide
26 Metal
52 Oil
260 Stone
```

The process then starts at the weapon question again. It will be asked again directly for the next calculation.

You can end the application with the key combination `Ctrl+C` or just by closing the window.
